In general, the effectiveness of any one computer standard has to be considered in relation to other members of that set. It follows that if conformance to any standard is in doubt, that fact can seriously call in question the value of conformance to many other standards where no such doubt should really exist.\n    Therefore Ecma International will seek to clarify the position over conformance to all kinds of computer standards in the interests of users, suppliers and the general public alike. That is the purpose of this report.\n  language:\n  - en\n  script:\n  - Latn\n  format: text/plain\nplace:\n- Geneva\ndoctype: document\next:\n  schema-version: v1.0.0\n"
